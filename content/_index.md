# Hasan Asim

## _Software Engineer_

Hello! I live in London, England and work at [Perlego](https://www.perlego.com/), the "Spotify for textbooks".

In the past, I worked at [Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com) in the data science department for three years, where I was part of a market intelligence team consisting of data scientists, software engineers, and QA analysts.

I also studied Computer Science at the University of Sheffield, spending my second year on exchange at the University of Hong Kong.

Outside of software, I'm really interested in [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) and figuring out how I can have a positive impact with my career. Check out [this](https://www.benkuhn.net/ea-reading/) blog post if you want to learn more about it.


If you think we'd have an interesting discussion about something then feel free to book a call with me [here](https://calendly.com/hasanasim) or send me an email.
