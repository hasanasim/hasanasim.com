## _Software Engineer_

I'm a Backend Software Engineer currently looking for my next role. I'm looking to take on lots of responsibility and continue to develop as much as I can as an individual contributor.

In the past, I've worked at [Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com) in the data department as a Software Engineer, using Python as my primary language for three years.

I also studied Computer Science at the University of Sheffield, spending my second year on exchange at the University of Hong Kong.

See my CV [here](/cv.pdf).

I'm also really interested in [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) and figuring out how I can have a positive impact with my career.

I live in London, England.
If you think we'd have an interesting discussion about something then feel free to book a call with me [here](https://calendly.com/hasanasim) or message me to hang out in person!
